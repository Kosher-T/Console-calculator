This is my first repo ever. I want this to be something I can be proud of later, but that's probably a foolish hope. There's no first of mine that I've been proud of later.

Anyway, this is a console-based calculator project, one made in accordance with instructions from [Coddy](https://coddy.tech). It is quite simple to use.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations and a proto-conversational version:
  '^', 'pow', '*', 'mul', '/', 'div', '%', 'mod', '+', 'add', '-', 'sub'

- User-friendly input format

- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., divide by zero)

- Parenthesis checks

- Lightweight and fast execution (most certainly didn't FEEL lightweight when I was writing it)

## Installation

*Installation instructions coming soon!*  
(For now, you can probably just clone the repo and run the main script if you have Python installed.)

## Usage

Enter ana arithmetic problem with as many operands and operators as you want:

- Simple, natural arithmetic (space or no space)

      5 add 4

     9

      20div5

     4.0

- Stacked operations (is that how I should describe it?)

      3 mul 5 div 2
  
     7.5
  
      6 + 7sub2*6 div 2
    
     7.0

- Parenthesis operations

      (5 pow 3 + 1)/4*(0.5)

     15.75

      7 mul (5 - 2)
